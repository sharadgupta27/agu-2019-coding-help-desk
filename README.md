# üíª Coding Help Desk

This is the official website of the Coding Help Desk at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2019 Fall Meeting.

[*add logo here*]

## üìù Description

Coding is becoming an increasingly important skill for geophysicists interested in data science and Big Data. However, it can be tough to know where to start, know how to get help, and find others who are interested in developing coding skills. The Coding Help Desk is meant to be a drop-in spot where anyone can come by to ask coding questions (any programming language), learn skills to help them with their research, and connect with fellow AGU members who are passionate about coding. The Coding Help Desk will also feature a series of coding and data management demos.

Please send an email to Sheila at ssaia at ncsu dot edu and let her know that you're interested in spreading the word about the Coding Help Desk. She'll send along a flier that you can share with others

6. I've never heard of this event at the AGU Fall Meeting. How did the Coding Help Desk get started?  <br> <br>
The AGU 2018 Fall Meeting in Washington, DC marked the first year of the Coding Help Desk. Sheila Saia and Sam Zipper started it in hopes of building a tight-knit coding community within AGU. Coding skills are becoming increasingly important for geophysicists in the age of "Big Data". Connecting with other AGU members, whether they are beginner or expert coders, can help advance coding training and effective use of coding tools for geoscience applications.
